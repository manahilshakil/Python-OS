# Python-OS
I took a course Using Python to interact with OS by Google and we went through many different applications of Python, which are mentioned below :
- Running Python locally
- File Handling
- CSV Files
- Regular Expressions
- OS module, Sys Module and many more
- Subprocesses
- Testing
- Bash Scripting
  
I havent added all the codes but I'll keep updating this repository.
